| Bad Debt         | Patient pays by cheque.  Practice dispenses glasses.  Cheque bounces.  Patient never pays off the remaining balance. After 12 months of asking to be paid, you want to write it off as 'Bad Debt'.                                                                | Practice keeps whatever amount they collected.  The cash position is unchaged.  WINK and your accountant however, will convert the "Account Receivable" into "Bad Debt Expense".                                    | Patient keeps the glasses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Cancel           | Patient leaves deposit for glasses and walks out of store.  Patient never comes back to pick up glasses.  You never dispense the glasses.  You want to Cancel the Invoice.                                                                                        | Practice will keep/confiscate the patient's deposit.  The accountant will convert the "Unearned Income" into "Cash".                                                                                                | The glasses sold to the patient go back into the store's inventory.  (If they were in a job tray, they go back on the shelf with a label/price).                                                                                                                                              |
| Refund           | Patient pays for glasses in full.  You dispense  glasses to patient.  One week later he returns to say that he can't see anything and wants a  refund.  You agree to give him a full/partial refund.                                                              | Practice will give the patient back his money.  Sales decrease.  Cash decreases.                                                                                                                                    | The glasses sold to the patient go back into the store's inventory.   They go back on the shelf for sale to another patient.  Once they're back, you may want to return them to your supplier.                                                                                                |
| Credit Note      | Patient pays for glasses in full.  You dispense glasses to patient. Six months later he returns to say that he can't see anything and wants a  refund.  You agree to give him a full/partial credit note that he can use against a future purchase in your store. | The practice's cash situation is unchanged.  This transaction however results in "unearned income" being on their books.   The cash dispensed by the patient, is now available as credit against a future purchase. | If the patient will keep the glasses, then the effect on inventory is null.  If the patient is giving you back the glasses, then go back into the store's inventory. They go back on the shelf for sale to another patient.  Once they're back, you may want to return them to your supplier. |
| Cash Only Refund | Patient buys glasses at full price on Nov 30.  You dispense the same day.  On December 1 you publicise a 50% off sale.  Patient returns to demand his 50% discount On Dec 5.  You want to issue a Cash Only Refund.                                               | Practice will give the patient back his money.                                                                                                                                                                      | Patient keeps the glasses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Conclusion       | Ask yourself:     - Have I dispensed the glasses or not?   - Am I giving money back to patient?   - Will the patient keep the glasses, or will I take them back?                                                                                                  | The practice's cash position is either unchanged, or decreases.                                                                                                                                                     | Inventory either increases, or is unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
